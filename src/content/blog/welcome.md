# Welcome to My Blog!

Hello everyone! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts, research notes, and discoveries here. This blog will cover various topics including:

- Physics Research
- Technology Innovation
- Film Creation
- Educational Projects

## Example of LaTeX Support

Here's an example of a mathematical equation using LaTeX:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

And here's the Schr√∂dinger equation:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right]\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
$$

## Code Example

Here's a simple Python code example:

```python
def calculate_energy(mass):
    c = 299792458  # speed of light in m/s
    return mass * (c ** 2)

# Calculate the energy of 1kg of matter
energy = calculate_energy(1)
print(f"E = {energy} joules")
```

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be sharing:

1. Research updates and findings
2. Technical tutorials and guides
3. Thoughts on education and technology
4. Project showcases and demonstrations

Stay tuned for more content!
